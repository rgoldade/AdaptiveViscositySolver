# Adaptive Viscosity Solver Plugin for Houdini

Source code from the SIGGRAPH 2019 technical paper [An Adaptive Variational Finite Difference Framework for Efficient Symmetric Octree Viscosity](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rgoldade/adaptiveviscosity/)

## Build
To build this project in Houdini (Linux):

1. Install Houdini 20.0 or higher.

2. Go to install folder (/opt/hfs.xx).

3. Type "source houdini_setup" to get the necessary environment variables.

4. Make a build folder the top level of the repository.

5. Run cmake .. in the build folder (if Eigen is preferred over native Houdini's Conjugate Gradient method, include -DUSEEIGEN=ON).

6. Run make in the build folder.

7. Verify that it was added to Houdini by:
	- Launch Houdini.
	- Press "tab" in the Network Editor and select a "DOP Network" and place it in the editor.
	- Jump into the DOP Network, press "tab" again and verify that "HDK Adaptive Viscosity" is searchable.

## Usage

1. Build your liquid simulation scene.

2. Unlock the FLIP Solver by right clicking on the DOP and selecting "Allow Editing of Contents".

3. Dive into the FLIP Solver, find the viscosity solver DOP called "gasviscosity" and disable it by selecting the "Bypass" radial menu option.

4. Place the "HDK Adaptive Viscosity" solver, wire it into the disabled "gasviscosity" DOP.
